== Description of AudioManager_PoC
The AudioManager Proof of Concept (AM PoC) is an Qt application, based
on Qt5 and QtQuick module. It uses the GENIVI AudioManager capabilities
to demonstrate how audio sources are managed based on  mixing rules
that are defined in the configuration file for AM Control Plugin:
"libPluginControlInterface.conf".

For a detailed description please consult the "libPluginControlInterface.conf",
"libPluginRoutingInterfacePulse.conf" and AudioManager documentation.

Also please visit the following link:

for a description of the GENIVI Demo Platform into which the AM PoC is
pre-integrated.

== How to add wav files to AudioManager PoC
Currently Am PoC uses aplay to play wav files using scripts. The audio wav files
are found in AudioManagerPoC/resources/audio/ and the scripts used are found
in AudioManagerPoC/resources/scripts.

Below is a description of which script plays what wav file:

   Script name     ||  Wav file played
===================||=====================
playCarReverse.sh  ||  car_reverse.wav
------------------------------------------
   playnav.sh      ||  navigation.wav
------------------------------------------
   playtel.sh      ||  telephone-ring.wav
------------------------------------------
   playtts.sh      ||  tts.wav
------------------------------------------

To change the wav files played, the following steps must be taken:
1. Edit the script corresponding to the file you want to change by
   changing the aplay file name parameter with the wav file name you
   want to use;
2. Edit the AudioManager_PoC.pro file by changing the corresponding
   wav file name in the files member of the audio install set; This
   ensures that the new audio wav file will be installed when deploying;

There is one script: playmusic.sh, for which the audio wav file is not provided
because of copyright issues.
To add a wav file for the playmusic.sh script do the following:
1. Edit the playmusic.sh script by changing the aplay file name parameter with
   the wav file name you want to use;
2. Edit the AudioManager_PoC.pro file by adding the corresponding
   wav file name in the files member of the audio install set; This
   ensures that the new audio wav file will be installed when deploying;

IMPORTANT !!
To stop playing the audio files, scripts are also used and can be found in
AudioManagerPoC/resources/scripts. Be sure that the grep parameter used to
search for the process that plays the audio file, corresponds to the wav file
name being played.

Example:
For the stopmusic.sh script, change "grep [U]NKLE" to "grep [y]our_wav_file.wav".
Do this for all the scripts that start with 'stop';
